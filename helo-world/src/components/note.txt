Function--
        *Simple functions
        *Use Function components as much as possible
        *Absence of 'this' keyword
        *Solution without using state
        *Mainly responsible for the using
        *Stateless/Dump/Presentational

Class--
    *More feature rich
    *Maintain their own private data-state
    *Complex UI logic
    *Provide lifecycle hooks
    *stateful/Smart/Container

JSX-- javaScript XML(JSX)

Context - context provides a way to pass data through the component three without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Hooks - they allow you to use react features withput having to write a class      
      - only call hooks at the top level

sueStateHook - the useState hook lets you add state to functional components
             - in classes, the state is always an object
             -with the useState hook, the state doesn't have to ba an object
             -the first element is the current value of the state, and the second element is a state setter function.
